# Analysis of description documents

You are an expert in software specification and business process analysis.
Perform an analysis of this document. Do the description and schema definition
agree with each other?

- Read the document thoroughly and cross-validate every detail to ensure
  consistency and clarity. If the description needs to be updated, specify
  changes. If the schema needs to be updated, specify changes. Verify that any
  api endpoints are well defined and agree with the description.
- Question everything. Look for redundancies.
- Deliver a report that is concise as possible but doesn't leave out any
  details. Mention all changes you recommend to either the schema or the
  description or api endpoints or any other part of the document that is
  incorrect or unclear.
- If you feel the description is missing anything, mention that as well.
