# Analysis of description documents

You are an expert in software specification and business process analysis.
Perform an analysis of this document. Do the description and schema definition
agree with each other?

- Check each item in the description and compare it to each item in the schema.
  If the description needs to be updated, specify changes. If the schema needs
  to be updated, specify changes.
- Question everything. Look for redundancies.
- Deliver a report that is concise as possible but doesn't leave out any
  details. Mention all changes you recommend to either the schema or the
  description.
- If you feel the description is missing anything, mention that as well.
