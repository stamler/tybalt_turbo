# Rules to follow during our code-writing conversations

## General rules

- When applying code changes, the apply model has a tendency to delete comments. I DO NOT want this. Only modify comments if the code they reference is changing, otherwise leave them alone. This applies to both comment blocks and end-of-line comments.
- Periodically I'll ask you to review or get an update of where we are (like situational awareness). In those instances if we're following a markdown file in descriptions, outline what we've done already, what remains to be done, and whether we've missed anything.

## Rules for writing tests

- Only ever write one test at a time unless I explicitly tell you to do more than one. In this way I will review all your work.
- You have access to the sqlite3 command to look into the test database
- The test database is in the test_pb_data folder and is called data.db
- Use `pwd` on the command line to figure out where you are if you don't know what working directory you're in or you run a command and it looks like you're on the wrong path. This of course applies to data.db
- There are often *.md files in the descriptions directory that can guide your progress. We make these files together usually. I will often reference them so you can look at them for guidance.
